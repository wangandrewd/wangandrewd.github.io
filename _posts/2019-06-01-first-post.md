Given my new venture, I have finally decided to start a blog, largely as a way to dissect my own thoughts. Previously, I was restricted from doing so given my employer was a family office (and therefore, there were potentially investment advice issues) but now I should be free and clear of my obligations.

Today is also the main day at my 5th year reunion. Food for thought:
-People you knew from freshman year of college have known you for 10 years. That is a third of your adult life
-Friends you have not seen in 5 years, you have not seen for half your relationship with them
-Yet, likely these same friends are people you feel like you saw just yesterday

My quick thought around this (warning, purely arm chair psychology) is that we perceive and attribute emotional weight things as a fraction of our lives. When you are young, every thing seems memorable because you have not had many experiences. As we grow older, that same fixed period of time is a lower percentage and therefore, lower significance to us. This should only bolstered by the fact that most of us have had pretty busy working lives the past few years and jobs are often monotonous experiences which are probably more easily compressed.

The natural corrollary here is that you treasure relationships from earlier points in your life. Similarly, the people you meet as you grow older may seem somewhat replaceable. Of course there is also the aspect of seeing the personal development journey of your friends upfront but I see that as somewhat correlated. Maybe this is all to say that we take greater satisfication hanging out with people we have known longest.
