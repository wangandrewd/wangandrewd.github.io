A lot of people like to point to QE / world flush with cash as one of the main causes of asset price increases. Unsurprisingly, for traditional businesses/asset classes, valuations are largely driven off of risk premia and the rate curve. I mean, what's the point of mezz in structures when there is a massive bid for equity at 12% right? All of this is to say is that growth is really expensive right now and investors are largely right that it is driven by excess liquidity.

However, an interesting notion to think about is whether this is the overwhelming factor in venture. Yes, of course, the movement of capital from traditional asset classes to venture has caused valuation multiples to surge immensely, but are the companies themselves scaling/derisking faster?

For example, if I were to run a DTC business 10 years ago, I would have to do it without the marketing channels of instagram, FB, etc. Those have been hugely influential in allowing these startups to acquire customers and run rapid development cycles. Similarly, building tech infrastructure has never been more scalable given how modular and package oriented the entire software industry has become. This is all to say, I would think that as time progresses and platforms/infrastructure/everything-non-core-as-a-service becomes more accessible, businesses are easier to scale and as a result, multiple expansion is just a natural result versus constant returns. I don't have data on this but someone should do a study to see if this is actually the case.

That said, one thing we should keep in mind is that this often causes many startups to be building "features" as opposed to "products". Their high leverage to these platforms make them susceptible to replacement by companies owning the relationship higher up in the acquisition funnel (think shopify with instagram). This is pretty tricky because then investors will have to do the margin scale replacement math more carefully.
