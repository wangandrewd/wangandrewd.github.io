I am currently the accidental CEO/Founder of a stealth startup. 

I spent most of my career investing in private credit and venture capital at Soros. Some cool things I focused on are
- Aircraft Engines (and more generally commercial aircraft)
- USDA Crops
- Litigation
- Consumer Finance
- Payments
- Music and Pharma Royalties
- Commercial Real Estate

I like to have thought experiments around the intersection of tech and business. My hobbies include tennis, running, cycling, and cooking.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything!
